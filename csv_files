csv....comma seperated values
it is a simple file formate used to store tabular data like database
each line of file represents a row of the table and each values are seperated by commas (field seperator)
to work with csv we have csv module in that we have csv.reader class,csv.dictreader class,csv.writer,csv.dictwriter classes are there

  ex: to write in csv file
import csv

# Open the CSV file in write mode and create a CSV writer
with open("emp.csv", "w", newline='') as f:
    w = csv.writer(f)

    # Write the header row
    w.writerow(["Eno", "Ename", "Esal", "Eaddr"])

    # Get the number of employees from the user
    n = int(input("Enter the number of employees:"))

    # Loop through the range of employees
    for i in range(n):
        # Get information for each employee from the user
        eno = input("Enter emp no:")
        ename = input("Enter emp name:")
        esal = input("Enter emp sal:")
        eaddr = input("Enter emp address:")

        # Write the information to the CSV file
        w.writerow([eno, ename, esal, eaddr])

print("CSV file has been successfully created with employee information.")




ex: to read in csv file

  import csv

# Open the CSV file in read mode
with open("emp.csv", "r") as f:
    r = csv.reader(f)
    data = list(r)

    # Loop through the rows in the CSV file
    for line in data:
        # Loop through the words in each row
        for word in line:
            print(word, "\t", end="")
        print()  # Move to the next line after printing each row
